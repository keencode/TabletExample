Having opened towards the end of the early wave of downtown Manhattan boutique hotels, 60 Thompson, a few years in, can now rightly be called an established classic.\r\\n\r\\nThe location doesn’t hurt, down one of SoHo’s swankier streets, and the carefully art-directed interiors have aged well (which is to say they haven’t visibly aged at all, unlike some other high-design vaguely Eastern-influenced properties). The soaring loft-style guest rooms are as quintessentially downtown as they come, a little bit luxe and a little bit boutique, with high-end Italian linens, 60 Thompson's Dean & Deluca pantries (we used to call them minibars) and bathrooms manage to be decadent and heavily marbled and yet stylish at the same time.\r\\n\r\\nOf course the rooms aren’t the whole story. A place like this lives and dies by its public spaces, which, in this case, are impeccable, from the guests-and-VIPs-only rooftop lounge to the Kittichai restaurant, an upscale Thai kitchen overseen by a Spice Market alumnus. This is the luxury boutique as it ought to be — plush but not precious, hip but not off-putting, and an authentic fixture in the nightlife of lower Manhattan.\r\\n\r\\n",

Not sure what the cache of this perk would be in colder/wetter weather. The TabletPlus Perks make this hotel a great value - I was upgraded from the basic room to the next level, and had plenty of space to move around. Received bottle of wine and fruit tray, which was better than expected. I like the dark, masculine styling of the rooms and the lobby. Good neighborhood, with good shopping and eating, although beware of constant metro changes in that area and hit-or-miss luck with cabs. ",

Quiet street far enough away from the \"mallification\" of lower Broadway that has taken some of the cool out of Soho.  Thompson is a quiet street with a great French cafe on the corner (Spring) and a worthy, inexpensive asian-fusion restaurant, Mooncake, on Watt street just south of Broome.  The staff is very friendly, helpful and attentive without being snobby.  The hotel is showing its age both in the design and wear, yet it is kept up very well. The room was ample size for NY (deluxe King) and sparkling clean.  The Fresh bath amenities are very good and for those who do not know, are a very high-end brand.  The rooftop bar is a MUST.  The hotel is much taller than surrounding buildings so you get stunning 360 degree views.  Access to the private roof bar is granted to guests by showing your key.  The restaurant Kiitichai is also good.",

The room was also on the small size and the view from the window was not great. Generally, however, it was a very pleasant stay. My suggestion would be that if you have the money for the 60 Thompson then  its probably worth to spend it and get one of their high end rooms with a view and use of their room service and restaurant (which is very good). But if, like us, you are on a certain budget and can only afford their standard room and even then only if you get it on a better rate through tablethotels then it may be worth to get another hotel altogether.

Ample fresh towels daily, shampoo & conditioner nice (not cheap), cotton swabs, cotton balls and hair dryer provided. Every evening there were 2 complimentry specialty brownies on our bed. Very very close to metro was a big plus.\r\\n\r\\nGood looking Bellmen who were more than accommodating and friendly at all times. Front Desk staff and hotel manager very helpful and overall just very pleasant without being too pushy or in your face. \r\\n\r\\nOverall an excellent choice! A perfect location, in a perfect neighbourhood. If you range from the age of 25 to 45, I think this is where you want to be -in the heart of Soho at a chic, boutique hotel that is not over the top but has just the right amount of style accompanied by excellent service!!!\r\\n\r\\n          ",

The caviar took 1/2 hour to get to us (though there were only 3 other people in the bar), and instead of apologizing, the server pulled a New York Hotel attitude that presumed we were from the back hills of nowhere.  Rude and condescending, and for a plate that cost $70, I was appalled at the lack of courtesy.  ",

We arrived at 3:45 & told our room wouldn't be ready until 4:30. We left bags & returned at 5pm- room still wasn't available. We were finally able to get into room 2.75 hours after check-in time. Next issue was our room reeked of stale cigarette smoke. We were told there were no other rooms to move us to 1st night, but that we'd be moved the next day. The staff brought up an industrial air purifier. Once in the room I went up to enjoy the view of the rooftop deck and have what I thought was a well deserved cocktail- only to be told there was a private party on the roof starting in 5 minutes and I would have to leave- Wasn't told anything about the roof deck closure at check-in & was disappointed that we couldn't use the space until after 10pm that night. The next morning, we were awakened to EXTREMELY strong cigarette smoke coming into our room from the adjoining room. We literally had to get up and leave the room (at 6:30am) after trying to plug the smell of the smoke with towels shoved under the door. We were given a different room as promised, but after everything that went wrong leading up to the room move we weren't upgraded or at least provided a room with a better view, or SOMETHING. We ended up on a lower floor which had a ton of street noise, and view of the building across the street. The new room was fine & staff was very pleasant & SUPER apologetic about the issues. We've normally stay at the Mondrian, the Mercer or James in SOHO and intentionally picked 60 Thompson to branch out and try something new. I have to say I was disappointed.",

            "hotel_content": "The American Radiator building is a strange and imposing landmark, a black-and-gold gothic skyscraper, towering above Bryant Park like something out of a comic book. How pleasantly surprising, then, to find that it houses a boutique hotel that is as sober and restrained as many of its competitors are loud and garish.\r\\n\r\\nRestrained doesn’t mean boring—just that the Bryant Park hotel eschews the kind of flashy showmanship that has become all too familiar in the boutique hotel world. The lobby, though decked out in rather unconventional black terra cotta and red leather, feels as serious as the building’s facade, without too-clever furniture or whimsical sculptural statements, and the Cellar Bar is true to its roots as well, with vaulted ceilings and tilework reminiscent of nothing so much as a restored subway station.\r\\n\r\\nAll the architectural sobriety doesn’t seem to be cramping the clientele’s style, especially during fashion week, which turns the park into an exhibition hall and momentarily makes the Bryant Park Hotel the most desirable address in New York.\r\\n\r\\nAs for the accommodations, a complete renovation from the American Radiator days apparently meant the death of many an interior wall—the rooms today are spacious, especially for a midtown hotel, and boast loft-style hardwood floors. Views tend toward the extraordinary, looking over Bryant Park, and some rooms come with private terraces, not at all New York standard. Expect lush goose-down duvets and rich linens, and massive tubs and sinks in the travertine bathrooms.\r\\n\r\\nThe cachet-meter has risen another notch or two with the opening of the New York outpost of LA’s painfully hip KOI sushi restaurant. Yet another reason for Bryant Park regulars to stop worrying about Soho and learn to love midtown.\r\\n\r\\n\r\\n\r\\n\r\\n",

The only negative was the bar and Koi - the bar was closed even to guests one night and packed another, when acoustics were terrible so you cldnt hold a conversation with someone right next to you. Koi is sub-par, very disappointing relative to its LA sister and Katana. Service was erratic as well.I wld stay at BPH again but certainly wldnt go back to Koi or the Cellar bar.",

The Service was great - although after tip and all - $20 for two OK coffees seems a lot for this not from New Yorker.  The carry outs we got from Starbucks the day before for $4 were sooo much better. We loved the room - an upgrade was no problem. The bed was extemely comfortable and possibly the best sleep I've had in a hotel for many years - loved the pillows - like heaven.  Would definitely book there again.  Thank you!",

We had to chase the hotel staff for absolutely everything we asked for, including someone to check us out (the front desk was completely unstaffed for 20 minutes while we waited). Our room was also sub-par - there was a hole in the bathtub which leaked water onto the bathroom floor! We used to recommend this hotel to others; not sure we will do so again.",
